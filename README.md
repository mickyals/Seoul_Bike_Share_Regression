> A multivariate regression model with the goal of predicting demand for a bike share service in Seoul. 

## Table of Contents
* SeoulBikeData.csv - dataset
* Bike_Share_Model.ipynb - notebook


## Conclusions
- A linear model does not properly explain the relationship between predictors and the response variable. A different Statistical modelling approach must be taken on this dataset.

# Acknowledgements
- This model was built using the [Seoul Bike Shaing Demand (2020) dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand).
